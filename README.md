# Professional README Generator
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

Here's where to begin!

<b>Installation<b>

Download Node.js
Clone the repo into your own repo
Navigate to the repo directory in your terminal. Type 'npm install inquirer' to install the inquirer node package manager.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js

Here's how to begin!

<b>Usage<b>
    
To start follow the install instructions. Once you have completed the install navigate to the directory with the index.js file in your temrinal. In the terminal type 'node index'. Follow and answer the prompts. When you are done your README.md file should be complete. The last thing you need to do is download any images you want in the read me to your image folder. Once that is done update your file paths and alt texts in the README.md file. For that all you should need to do is enter the file name where indicated and enter your alt tex where indicated.
